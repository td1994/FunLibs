This project takes a story and asks the user to input various type of words(nouns, verbs, etc.) and replaces them in a story. The results are diplayed to the user and saved if desired.

When the program is run it interactively asks the user for a type of word from the story script and then replaces that section with the given word. The focuses of the project were the Rule of Simplicity by breaking up the functionality, Transparency by having clear ideas shown through our coding, and Optimization by making sure the code is functional with the lowest complexity before adding onto it.
